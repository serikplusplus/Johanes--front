			A translation of a marketing or commercial text by one of our translators
			does exactly what it's supposed to do: win over your readers. We don't
			just translate a text word for word. Marketing translations require a fair
			amount of liberties to be taken in order to meet the needs and desires of
			your target audience abroad. While translating marketing texts, our
			translators may consult you about any cultural differences that need to be
			taken into account. As far as content goes, your translation will of
			course be identical to the source text, unless the briefing states
			otherwise. We are also experienced in providing SEO translations.
