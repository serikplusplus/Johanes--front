				A convincing marketing translation
			</h2>
			<p class="sub-info__text">
				A translation of a marketing or commercial text by one of our
				translators does exactly what it's supposed to do: win over your
				readers. We don't just translate a text word for word. Marketing
				translations require a fair amount of liberties to be taken in order to
				meet the needs and desires of your target audience abroad. While
				translating marketing texts, our translators may consult you about any
				cultural differences that need to be taken into account. As far as
				content goes, your translation will of course be identical to the source
				text, unless the briefing states otherwise. We are also experienced in
				providing SEO translations.
